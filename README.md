## Machine Learning Internship - Task 3 

### Project Title
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Titanic Dataset (Kaggle).

### Description
This Project is Completed as the Part of Machine Learning Internship at "RD Infro Technology".
The Aim of this project(Task-3) is to "Clean and Preprocess" the raw data to make it ready for Machine Learning Models.

### Dataset
Titanic Dataset from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset

### Tasks Performed
- Load the dataset using Pandas (pd.read_csv)
- Displayed dataset information using df.info()
- Checked missing values
- Filled missing values in "Age" using mean method
- Filled missing values in "Embarked" using mode method
- Removed the "Cabin" column due to many missing values
- Encoded categorical variables using get_dummies
- Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler

### Tools used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Outcome
The Titanic dataset was successfully "Cleaned and Preprocessed" and now is ready for Machine Learning models.
